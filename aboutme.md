I am an M.Sc. student in satellite technology, and I was looking for an opportunity to learn AI and use it in real life applications due to my great interest in AI. Finally, I was able to pursue this field more seriously in my master's degree, I am currently a python Developer and work on Computer Vision projects using Deep Learning.My research focuses on object recognition especially analysis, implementation and development of single-stage object detectors for high-resolution satellite images with arbitrary orientations, large aspect ratios and dense arrangement.
