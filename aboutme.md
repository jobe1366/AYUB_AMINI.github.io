title: About me
subtitle: Who am I ?
---
I am a MSc student in _satellite technology_ and I have finished master degree at [IUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_University_of_Science_and_Technology "Iran_University_of_Science_and_Technology" ). I was looking for an opportunity to learn AI and use it in real life applications due to my great interest in AI. Finally, I was able to pursue this field more seriously in my master's degree, I am currently a python Developer and work on Computer Vision projects using Deep Learning.
My research focuses on _object recognition especially analysis, implementation and development of single-stage object detectors for high-resolution satellite images with arbitrary orientations, large aspect ratios and dense arrangement_
